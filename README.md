# kaijuGL V0.0.5
A "strange beast" of a engine

Hello, for this test branch main.cpp is only being used to build and manage the window/ input context. Everything you see and should need to interact with lives insise the file BasicMovment.cpp/hpp (and every other source file), but this file specificaly affects what is drawn and bound or really exists...

the files located in Tests contain old examples/ saves and can be usefull for understanding how somethings work

This contains forks of GLM, IMGUI, and stb_image for now in the future they will be removed
