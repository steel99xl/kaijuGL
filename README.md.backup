# kaijuGL V0.0.6
A "strange beast" of a game engine

Hello, for this test branch main.cpp is only being used to build and manage the window/ input context. Everything you see and should need to interact with lives insise the file BasicMovment.cpp/hpp (and every other source file), but this file specificaly affects what is drawn and bound or really exists...

Currently this is setup to show off dynamic resolution based on a frame rate target 

the files located in Tests contain old examples/ saves and can be usefull for understanding how somethings work

This contains forks of GLM, IMGUI, and stb_image for now in the future they will be removed

currently IMGUI is not being used but is still here for no real reason...
